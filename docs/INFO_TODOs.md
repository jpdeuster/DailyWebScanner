As of: 2025-10-22

Repository scan results:
- No occurrences of "TODO" / "ToDo"
- No occurrences of "FIXME" / "TBD"
- No occurrences of "later to develop"

Manually identified placeholders
- AnalysisView.swift: "Coming Soon" placeholder
  - Task: Specify and implement the analysis feature (UI, data binding, metrics/charts)
  - Task: Remove placeholder once implemented
- ComingSoonView.swift: Generic placeholder view
  - Task: Remove/replace once affected features are complete

Guidance for future work:
- Please create new tasks as GitHub Issues or clearly mark them in code with `TODO("ShortTitle")` so they can be found automatically.
- For larger topics, consider GitHub labels (e.g., enhancement, bug, docs).
